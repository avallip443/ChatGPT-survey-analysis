## ChatGPT Survey Analysis

This program uses Matplotlib, NumPy, and pandas to analyze the responses from a survey and generate graphs. The survey measure opinions about the use of ChatGPT by students and whether universities should allow it or not, taking into account the 120+ respondants' background, education, and professional experience.

These graphs were used to analyze and draw conclusions about the academic perception of ChatGPT, its benefits and limitations within academia, and its role in shaping the future of education. This was then presented as a report associated with CPS412 (Social Issues, Ethics and Professionalism) at Toronto Metropolitan University.
